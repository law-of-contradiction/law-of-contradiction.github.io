# How do we know... anything?

Here's how we know!

## Every thing

We start by describing "a description": "every thing is a description". Now we don't have to worry about identifying a description, because everything we identify is a description. Is *that thing* a description? Yes, *every thing* is a description.

We continue by describing "a definition" or "a thing's definition": "a description of a thing where the description and the thing are the same thing." What's "the same thing"? We'll get to that in the section about the principle of contradiction.

We call "a thing we describe only by definitons" a thing that that has a description that is *metaphysical*, or a thing that is metaphysical.

We call "a thing *not* only-described-by-definition" something else. Either that thing isn't described at all, or that thing is described in any other way. We call "a thing we describe not-only-by-definition" a thing that has a description that is *physical*, or a thing that is physical.

Metaphysical things and their description is "metaphysics"; physical things and their description is "physics".

## Metaphysics

Stated above, metaphysical things are described only by definitons. Some definitions are clear, some are unclear, some are precise, some are vague. We stated above that we rely on definitions which are the same as what they describe, which means we can't have metaphysics for anything that is indescribable, because we can't describe it with a definition. But why is "a description that is indescribable" not a definition, and what is "a thing and a description that are the same thing"? We describe this using the principle of contradiction.

### True-and-not-true

The principle of contradiction is a description, and like any other description we may have it in a given metaphysics or not have it. If we have the principle of contradiction, we can differentiate between things that are true and things that are not-true, with respect to one another in a given metaphysics. This is because the principle says that true-and-not-true things--that is, things that are both true and not-true--are excluded from the given metaphysics, and these things are not-true in the given metaphysics. As an aside, "paraconsistent" metaphysics still excludes things that are in some way true-and-not-true, which means it still follows the principle of contradiction, although with a different formulation.

The principle of contradiction is the mutual exclusion of descriptions. First, and most importantly, if a description excludes itself, then it is true-and-not-true, and a metaphysics that has the principle of contradiction excludes true-and-not-true descriptions. Secondly, because everything is a description, several descriptions together are a description. From this, descriptions can exclude one another, if adding them together is true-and-not-true. If one description is true, then the descriptions it excludes are not-true. Now we can fully describe "a definition", because "the description and the thing are the same thing" if the description is not excluded by the principle of contradiction. Because of this, in a given metaphysics with the principle of contradiction, each definition may depend on any other definition in the given metaphysics.

### Formal metaphysics

We have the principle of contradiction, which is the fundamental aspect of a definition. It excludes definitions that are true-and-not-true. Without it, our metaphysics of definitions is indiscriminate. Our metaphysics can now be discriminate, where descriptions may be mutually-exclusive true or not-true. We will call these metaphysics "formal" metaphysics. The system that describes formal metaphysics is called *algebra*. Algebra is a formal system of symbols and rules. Algebra is what describes math and logic. We will find that a given formal metaphysics, algebra, math, and logic applies extremely well to something beyond metaphysics: physics.

## Physics

[We have described physics](#all_the_things) as "things that are described not-only-by-definition", which contrasts with metaphysics which we described as "things that are described only by definition." The part of the description that is not-only-by-definition is everything else, which we call physics. Unlike metaphysics, physics do not provide us with a definiton for everything. We have no way of knowing if physical things are by definition true or not-true. We find that some physical things are reproducible. We find, perhaps surprisingly, that formal metaphysics describes these reproducible physical things extremely well.

### The metaphysics of physics

The ability to reproduce a physical thing gives us an opportunity to describe physics with formal metaphysics. As the principle of contradiction is to metaphysics, reproducibility is to physics. We can't explicitly find whether a physical thing excludes or contradicts another physical thing, because we have no metaphysical definitions for these things. However, we can use a description of the reproduction of these physical things, and the description can have at least some formal metaphysical definitions. If our formal metaphysical-physical description corresponds closely to the physical things, that's as close to a metaphysical truth as we can get. All other options are farther away: not having a description at all, having an informal description which might violate the principle of contradiction, or having a physical thing that is simply not reproducible. The formal reproducible physics is the best description we have.

Are there really no other methods get closer to the truth about physical things? There must be other methods! What if we could reveal the underlying metaphysical truth about the physical world? Then either that truth is reproducible or unreproducible. If it's reproducible, it should be supported by our formal reproducible physics. If it's unreproducible, we have no method to describe it, and it's only knowable through the informal revelation of truth, which is informal metaphysics, which is prone to contradiction.

## Know all the things

We've found that these physics and metaphysics describe everything that is knowable with the principle of contradiction. We've found that without the principle of contradiction, true and not-true lose their distinction from each other.

We've found that our best physical knowledge of the world comes from formal metaphysical definitions and reproducible physics.

Everything else is on shaky grounds at best.

And that is how we know anything.
